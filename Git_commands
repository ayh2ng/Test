Command Lines for Github
These git commands will only work in the repository folder in your cmd
How to properly use Github, you always want to start by doing git pull, then make your changes, git add and then git commit
Sometimes you run into conflicts and you will see <<<<<<<<<< Head <your changes> ======== <their changes> >>>>>>>>>>>>, you have to fix this
and commit again.

1) git clone <link: html:\\......>

This command is to download repositories for github into the folder you designated

2) git add <file name.extention>
	git add . <will add everything in your directory> 
	git add -A  <will add everything in your directory, -A stands for all>

This will add any changes into the local repository, but not yet uploaded into the git cloud repository, use this to also add untracked files
that you might have pulled created by other users

3) git status 

Gives you a view of what is added, committed, status of the local repository

4) git commit 
	git commit -m "gives it a message note" - this works after you type git add or git add -A
	git commit -a <commits all files that is changed in the repository>
	git commit <file> -m "message> - if you want to commit a certain file and not all files

This will commit the change into the cloud repository, to locked in.
Sometimes you will run into merge issues, and after you fix it, you do git add -A, git commit, and see command 8), it triggers a multi line message

5) git push

This will push the commited file up into the cloud repository

the git diff, press Q
